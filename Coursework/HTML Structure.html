<! -- DOCTYPE declaration
Head tag with a title tag
H1 tag with a title of your choice
Embed an image
Create the following three links on your page:
One link that is target="_blank" so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
Make the second link bold.
Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.
HINT: You should be looking up at the screen pretty often :P -->
